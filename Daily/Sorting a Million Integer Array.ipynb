    "# Sorting a Million Integer Array\n",
    "Given an array of a million integers between zero and a billion, out of order, how can you efficiently sort it? Assume that you cannot store an array of a billion elements in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Idea: Sorting by an algorithm like quicksort or merge sort would give us an average time complexity of O(N log N). But we can take advantage of the fact that our input is bounded and only consists of integers to do even better. One algorithm that can perform particularly well in these cases is called radix sort."

We must perform this sort k times, where k is the number of digits in the maximum number, in this case 10. The time complexity of this algorithm is therefore O(10 * N), or if we treat k as constant, O(N)."
