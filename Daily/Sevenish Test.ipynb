    "Hint: Often when a problem involves taking powers of numbers, there is a bitwise solution, and this is no exception. Note that when we convert a number to binary, we represent it using the form xk* 2k+ xk-1* 2k-1 + ... + x0* 20. To find unique sums of powers of 7, then, we can imagine that each bit represents a power of 7 instead of 2! Let's look at the first few sevenish numbers to see how this works:\n",
