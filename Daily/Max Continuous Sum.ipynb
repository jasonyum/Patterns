    "### This is actually called Kadane's Algorithm\n",
    "First -- cool name. Second, this is a dynamic programming concept. Maybe it helps to have the brute force version to compare it to, but this max_here version is the Kadane algorithm approach. This comment from Wikipedia is very helpful: \n",
    "\n",
    "> A bit of a background: Kadane's algorithm is based on splitting up the set of possible solutions into mutually exclusive (disjoint) sets. It exploits the fact that any solution (i.e., any member of the set of solutions) will always have a last element $i$ (this is what is meant by \"sum ending at position $i$). Thus, we simply have to examine, one by one, the set of solutions whose last element's index is $1$, the set of solutions whose last element's index is $2$, then $3$, and so forth to $n$. It turns out that this process can be carried out in linear time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Kadane's algorithm begins with a simple inductive question: if we know the maximum subarray sum ending at position $i$ (call this $B_{i}$), what is the maximum subarray sum ending at position $i+1$ (equivalently, what is $B_{{i+1}}$)? The answer turns out to be relatively straightforward: either the maximum subarray sum ending at position $i+1$ includes the maximum subarray sum ending at position $i$ as a prefix, or it doesn't (equivalently, $B_{i+1}=\\max(A_{i+1},A_{i+1}+B_{i})$ $B_{i+1}=\\max(A_{i+1},A_{i+1}+B_{i})$, where $A_{i+1}$ is the element at index $i+1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Thus, we can compute the maximum subarray sum ending at position $i$ for all positions $i$ by iterating once over the array. As we go, we simply keep track of the maximum sum we've ever seen. Thus, the problem can be solved with the following code, expressed here in Python:"
