    "Python is actually behaving as defined. Three separate functions are created, but they each have the closure of the environment they're defined in - in this case, the global environment (or the outer function's environment if the loop is placed inside another function). This is exactly the problem, though - in this environment, i is mutated, and the closures all refer to the same i.\n",
